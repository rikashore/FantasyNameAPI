# FantasyNameAPI
A simple web API that gives out random fantasy based names and descriptions


# Running the API  
## Resources  
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Configuration  
After installing PostgreSQL and setting up, the schema is a string based primary key, an array of names and an array of descriptions  
A model representing this can be found at [`FantasyModel`](https://github.com/shift-eleven/FantasyNameAPI/blob/main/FantasyNameAPI/Models/FantasyModel.cs)

Running it locally is as easy as cloning the repository and running it in your IDE or text editor of choice
